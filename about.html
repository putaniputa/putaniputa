    <br>Hi, I'm Sushma, an artist turned engineer turned artist.
        I always loved to draw things since I was a kid - since I can remember - I still have some of those sheets of
    paper.
    <br><br>And then, when I got trained as an engineer - I loved to make things work, to look at things around us with awe and to ask
    questions.
    <br><br>Now I'm trying to bring it all together by illustrating to spark curiosity about all the wonderful things around us in a
    simple beautiful engaging ways.
