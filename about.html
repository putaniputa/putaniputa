    <br>I always loved to draw things since I was a kid - since I can remember - I still have some of those sheets of paper.
    <br>And then I got trained as an engineer - to make things work, to look at things around us with awe and to ask questions.
    <br>Recently I've been learning to sketch and illustrate and paint with a renowned artist.
    <br>This is my small attempt to spark some curiosity about all the wonderful things around us in a simple beautiful engaging way.
